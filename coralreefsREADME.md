Coral Reef Facts

Coral reefs are rocky mounds and/or ridges formed in the sea by living things through the accumulation and deposition of limestone (calcium carbonate).

These undersea palaces are home to more species of fishes, corals, and many other type of marine life than any other ocean habitat.

Coral reefs also provide many valuable services to humans. Food, shoreline protection, and medicines are just a few of these benefits. These are also the best places to visit if you want to experience marine life - up close and personal.

Our "coral reef facts" website is organized around three main topics:

1. Coral Reef Structure
Coral reef formation involves a variety of processes operating at different spatial scales, and our discussion of how coral reefs are formed reflects that reality.
At smaller spatial scales we can examine reef building process at the level of the individual reef.

At broader spatial scales, we can consider the processes affecting the structure and formation of entire coral reef ecosystems.
How Are Individual Reefs Built?
The structural foundation of individual coral reefs is formed by a multitude of marine animals and plants through the processes of slow accumulation and deposition of calcium carbonate (limestone) extracted from seawater.

The Main Reef Builders
While a wide variety of marine life ultimately contributes to the structural complexities of coral reefs, most of the reef's underlying solid framework is constructed by just a few types of marine organisms.

These are the "stony" corals, and the coralline red algae that grows upon and amidst the coral colonies.

Shallow marine waters are rich in calcium (Ca++) and bicarbonate (HCO3-) ions.

Hard corals and coralline algae are able to extract these raw materials from sea water, and both types of marine life have the ability to combine them to form calcium carbonate (CaCO3).

This substance, also known as limestone, is used to fashion the protectecive outer skeletons of coral polyps as well as to harden the fleshy parts of the coralline algae.

After the individual organisms die, they leave behind their limestone skeletons. Over time, the accumulated and compacted minerals contained in the multitudes of these skeletal remains become the large, solid structures we call coral reefs.

The overall reef-building process is slow; coral reefs are built over decades and centuries - not weeks or months.
